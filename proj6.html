		    <p>Sefirin Kizi</p>
            <p>The storyline of Sefirin Kizi revolves around two main characters ‘Nare’ and ‘Sancar’. Nare is the daughter of an ambassador and Sancar is a son of a sharecrop farmer. Both of them love each other since childhood and have a dream to marry each other.<br><br></p>
           <p>Finally, they marry each other, but on the wedding night, it comes into the knowledge of Sancar that Nare is a victim of rape. On the insist of Sancar, she tells that she has been harassed and raped at home by someone. After discussing the truth to Sancar, Nare decides to leave his life and disappears.<br><br></p>
		   <p>On the other hand, most of the people think Nare has died. After 8 years, Sancar decides to move on in his life, but again, Nare appears again on his wedding ceremony with a girl Melek. She tells people that Melek is the daughter of Sancar. All in all, it’s full of emotions and Turkish suspense series that you must watch this year. No doubt, more surprising will come in this drama of Engin Akyürek.<br><br></p>
