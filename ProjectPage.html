           <p>We are a website of recommendations of the best Turkish series of all time, we created this for people like you who have a interested in knowing more about these incredible and romantic series.<br><br></p>
	    <p>We are also a group that studies engineering in Venezuela, Maracaibo; We're about to graduate on Computer Engineering at URBE from (August 2017 - July 2021). Then, we'll explode this incredible career. <br><br> Upon finishing our career, our goal would be to find work completing one of our dreams, which would be to work at NASA. Our role in my job dream at NASA would be to develop, test, and evaluate fundamental technologies in various areas, including autonomous systems, artificial intelligence, superior computing, computing, and human factors research for aviation and space. As a second option, we would also enjoy working in the programming area for international enterprises, or program websites like this one or others. <br><br></p>
	    <p>Any work in which we would participate in branding, creating or programming would interest us greatly, and we thoroughly enjoy expressing ourself through our programs in a way that allow for them to be recognized throughout the world.<br><br></p>
	    <p>Thankful for having this opportunity to study what we love and having this experience at URBE.<br><br></p>
